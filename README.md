A while ago I stumbled upon a vulnerability on a website with millions of users.

Yeah, you heard that right: **stumbled upon.**

The thing is, I’m not a hacker. Far from it — I’ve never tried to hack anything.

I was browsing the website as usual and realized it had a potential vulnerability. And then I got scared, **really scared.**

I knew enough about these things to know that:

a) What I found could _potentially_ be very dangerous for them

b) A wrong move in possession of this knowledge could be problematic for me

So I did what you’re supposed to do — I reported it. 4 times.

The problem is: they did not have a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/). This means there was no formal way for me to inform the team of this issue, and no guidelines on how they handle such disclosures.

That’s the scary part. Without such a policy, people who find vulnerabilities on a service, even if by accident, have to make a decision between their sense of moral responsibility and their own safety.

Now, I don’t know if the flaw I found would have exposed sensitive data, but in theory, it could. I didn’t try to find out, that’s not up to me, and trying to go deeper can be a serious issue.

I found it, reported it, got the hell out of there, and proceeded to have a sleepless night — even though I had done nothing wrong.

# No Good Guys Allowed

The story above has a happy ending.

The company received my report, fixed it immediately, and thanked me for disclosing it.

However, that’s not always how it goes. If you spend some time in online cybersecurity forums, you’ll find that often times vulnerabilities found by proper researchers will be ignored or go unreported for fear of retaliation from the company.

Not having a Responsible Disclosure Policy or retaliating against well-intentioned white hat hackers (hackers that hack _for good_) is like having a sign in front of your establishment saying “No Good Guys Allowed”.

And where good guys aren’t allowed is where the bad guys like to hang out.

# Building a website is as easy as 1–2–3

We’ve come a long way since the internet was invented, and now, almost anyone can have a website.

One can attain the necessary skills to build and launch a website for free in about a week. And if they don’t want to build it themselves, there’s a myriad options of services that will do it for you.

**This is a great thing.**

It’s awesome that we can now share our thoughts, advertise our products, and connect with others so easily, but it comes with a price.

Just as building websites and software in general is becoming easier, so is hacking them.

I mean, we’ve all seen the reports of teenagers hacking into government organizations and big companies.

This happens because what’s on the internet is available to anyone and everyone, and some people are bound to try to break it.

Anyone who has ever run a web server knows this. Your server will get hundreds, if not thousands, of [very weird requests](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/40291/strange-requests-to-web-server) every day, including requests for stuff like PDFs about 1700s Russian History. These are all attempts to find just one mistake that will compromise the entire security of your website.

Learning the skills to exploit simple yet damaging vulnerabilities is not extremely hard, and there are also a bunch of tools out there that scan these vulnerabilities for you **completely automatically.**

For less-elaborate exploits, hackers may as well setup the tools to search online for issues they can take advantage of and leave the house to grab a coffee. And they do.

As a result, we end up with news of various major hacks every year, some uncovering issues by major companies that are so trivial that even an intern should have been able to handle them.

Examples include [XSS in Tweetdeck](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/11/twitter-tweetdeck-xss-flaw-users-vulnerable), [the iPhone Integer Underflow](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/12/setting-the-date-to-1-january-1970-will-brick-your-iphone-ipad-or-ipod-touch), [WhatsApp’s Black Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC4NNUYIIdM), [Lenovo shipping devices with Superfish malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfish), [Adobe’s terrible password security](https://www.troyhunt.com/adobe-credentials-and-serious/), among many others.

Just last year, a hacker (or group) by the name GnosticPlayers [exposed almost **1** **billion** (yes, that’s a **b**) user records in just a few months](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-has-dumped-nearly-one-billion-user-records-over-the-past-two-months/).

Leaks and breaches are all around us.

Data associated with my previous email, for example, has been leaked at least six times:

You can try this yourself here: [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

There’s steps we can all individually take to help protect our data, and I recommend we all take them. I, for instance, am on a [privacy-craze](https://github.com/yakkomajuri/privacy-initiative) these past years.

However, there’s another (unlikely) solution to help diminish the number and impact of security breaches.

# Embracing hackers as a solution

Believe it or not, a lot of the problems mentioned above could be solved by just embracing the hackers.

For most of us, the term “hacker” still carries a negative connotation, but that’s a flawed perspective.

If we work with the assumption that most people have good intentions, the same principle also applies to hackers.

And indeed, there are white hat and black hat hackers — one is your worst enemy, but the other one should be your best friend.

Black hat hackers are the ones we hear about in the news, on a segment about election meddling or a leak of user details from your favorite graphic design website.

However, on the other side of the spectrum are the white hat hackers. The good guys. These are “ethical hackers” that try to find vulnerabilities on websites not to exploit them, but to help services fix them and prevent a black hat hacker from finding them.

These hackers are probably one of the top reasons the internet is not completely insecure and still usable.

But the problem is: we don’t support them enough.

In this regard, Big Tech gets it. It’s one of the few things me and Big Tech are on the same page about. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and most other top technology firms all have a broad Responsible Disclosure / Bug Bounty program that pays well and protects white hat hackers.

> “Find a way to hack into your local cafe’s website and you could go to jail. Find a way to hack into Facebook and you could become a millionaire.”

Despite having massive Cybersecurity and InfoSec departments, these companies still realize the value of supporting the white hat hacker community for their own good.

Some governments understand that too. [The Pentagon](https://www.hackerone.com/blog/hack-the-pentagon-results) has run programs for white hat hackers, as well as the [UK’s Ministry of Justice](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/), to name a few.

What they realize, is that security is always a tradeoff between the marginal cost of patching the next vulnerability and the presumed marginal benefit from doing so. This is why we have 2m high walls surrounding our houses, not 20m ones. The cost would be too high for only a minor **marginal** improvement in safety.

In other words, it’s impossible to make your service 100% secure, so you need to allocate your limited resources accordingly and prioritize what vulnerabilities to fix, assuming you could even know them all.

What you can then do is open your service up for the public scrutiny of the world and reward them for helping you secure areas of your service you couldn’t find or don’t have enough resources to fix yourself.

Everyone wins.

Websites like [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/) or [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/) allow companies to easily launch a robust Responsible Disclosure program and help companies identify critical issues in their products and services.

And what’s more: many of the companies don’t even offer monetary rewards. Hackers will often spend hours or days testing services for free, only for the intellectual challenge, the possibility of winning a T-Shirt, or maybe being named on the company’s website.

Not everyone can afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year necessary to run a reasonable Cybersecurity department. But every website owner can afford a [security.txt file](https://securitytxt.org/) and encourage white hat hacking on their website.

Our increased focus on building digital products coupled with a lack of investment into cybersecurity and a marginalization of white hat hackers harms everyone.

It means those who are skilled hackers are more likely to tip over to “the dark side” due to a lack of support, as well as those considering a career in ethical hacking may be forced to think twice.

The gap in the cybersecurity jobs market is [already in the millions and growing fast](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martenmickos/2019/06/19/the-cybersecurity-skills-gap-wont-be-solved-in-a-classroom/#331b70761c30), and I can completely understand why.

Ask me today: “Would you wanna be an ethical hacker?”

And my answer would be:

“Fuck that — I’d rather sleep at night”.
